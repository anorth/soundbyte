MORE FREQS / LONGER BLOCK BETTER
- constructive interference from reflections off walls etc
- less susceptible to narrow band interference
- less susceptible to short loud interference
- sounds more like white noise (better if using audible frequencies)


LESS FREQS / SHORTER BLOCK BETTER
- energy concentrated into fewer bands
- can do correllations on individual frequencies more efficiently than fft for all frequencies 
- just by ear, using more frequencies seems to have some kind of odd artifacts going on, could just be subjective though.
